# Geojson-to-Navigation-Node-Network
An Outdoor and Indoor Route Navigation System requires a node network for the shortest route search. However, GeoJSON cannot be used for route search because it lacks link information between lines. This software converts GeoJSON to a node network JSON, which can be used for the route search module.
